i set up an account in Mongodb and Heroku. and made a basic database in mongo to start the project

-installed flask: sudo pip3 install flask

Download and install MongoDB client 4.0.6 for Atlas
wget -q https://git.io/fh7vV -O /tmp/setupmongodb.sh && source /tmp/setupmongodb.sh

go to settings and set python to python3(was auto set to python2)
                                                ==========
deploy app to heroku                                                        https://youtu.be/15HJAVSID6A

-heroku login--email and pass
-check apps in heroku ---heroku apps

git init --initialise git repo

git add .
git commit -m"initial commit"
heroku git:remote -a project-3-gaa-players-2019
git push heroku master                              (failed...no requirements.txt)
sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
git add .
git commit -m"added requirements.txt"
git push heroku master                              (failed..missing procfile(file used to call app))
echo web: python app.py > Procfile          (procfile is an instruction to heroku as to which file is used as Ã¨ntry point to app)
git add .
git commit -m"added Procfile"
git push heroku master

heroku ps:scale web=1                   #command to heroku to get up and running
go to heroku -- settings -- config vars and set:
IP = 0.0.0.0 and PORT = 5000
                                                    =========
                                                    
CONNECTING FLASK TO MONGODB ATLAS                                               https://youtu.be/Lh6Lj9Lsc2k

now we install pymongo and dnspython:
sudo pip3 install flask-pymongo
sudo pip3 install dnspython             #for using new style connection string for mongodb atlas

had to delete and reinstall requirements.txt as it hadnt populated with dnspython,pymongo etc

                                                    
did a commit to git repo

in mongo..went to security-add new user and added user/pass
then ipwhitelist...allow access from anywhere

now we go to mongo to get our connection string:
overview-connection-connect your application.... and copy the connection string:
mongodb+srv://shoot:<password>@myfirstcluster-ojgpn.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true
this is then pasted into quote on line 81 above(app.config["MONGO_URI"] = '') and then pasted into app.py
                                                    ==========

now open new command line:
type: cd ..                         #to go up a level
type: nano .bashrc                  #to open nano

go down a few lines and paste in:
export MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://shoot:<password>@myfirstcluster-ojgpn.mongodb.net/project-3-GAA-Players-2019?retryWrites=true"
        ###dont forget to put password in
now ctrl x to exit....y to save...enter to return to bash

close bash and open again

now type: echo $MONGO_URI                   #and it prints out the connection

go to settings in HEROKU - reveal config vars and put in new key and values:
key = MONGO_URI
value = mongodb+srv://shoot:<password>@myfirstcluster-ojgpn.mongodb.net/project3-gaa-players?retryWrites=true 

now paste this into app.py under:                               #(under app = Flask(__name__))
app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = 'project3-GAA-Players-2019-centric'
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.getenv('MONGO_URI', 'mongodb://localhost')


made .gitignore file
